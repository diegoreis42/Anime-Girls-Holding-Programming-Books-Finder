# anime-girls-finder

That's a collaborative repo to practice programming languages. How? Finding random photos of anime girls holding programming books of course! The goal is embrace all programming languages (at least most of them).

# How can I collaborate?

Simple. Fork this repo, create a branch with the name of the programming language you choose to implement, create a folder with the name of the programming language you choose to implement, commit your awesome code with the name...(you get it), make a Pull Request and that's it, you made the world a better place (or something like that).

# Requisites

Your awesome code must be a CLI (Command Line Interface), the photos must be in this [repo](https://github.com/cat-milk/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books) and  **no frameworks** just the plain language :). You are free to do anything else!
